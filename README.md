## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to build predictive models that estimate the prices for Uber and Lyft rides. The models take into account several factors such as distance, time of day, weather conditions, and surge pricing to provide accurate price predictions. By leveraging historical data and machine learning algorithms, we can develop models that help users estimate the cost of their rides in advance.

The repository contains the following components:

1. **Data**: This directory holds the dataset used for training and evaluating the models. It may include historical ride data, weather data, and other relevant information.

2. **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization steps. The notebooks provide a step-by-step guide to understanding the price prediction process.

3. **Models**: This directory stores the trained machine learning models. It includes saved model files or scripts necessary for model deployment and inference.

4. **Documentation**: This directory contains additional documentation, such as data dictionaries, explanations of model features, and any other relevant information.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/salmanfaishal27/Price_prediction_Uber-lyft.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies. The dependencies for each project may vary, so it is recommended to refer to the respective project's documentation for detailed installation instructions.

## Usage
To use the price prediction models, follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to the **Notebooks** directory and open the Jupyter notebooks in a suitable environment.

2. Follow the instructions provided within the notebooks to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

3. Once the models are trained and evaluated, you can use them to make predictions on new data or deploy them as part of a larger application or service.

Please note that the specific usage instructions may vary depending on the project structure and the contents of the repository. Make sure to read the documentation and comments within the code for detailed instructions.
