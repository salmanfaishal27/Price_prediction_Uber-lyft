# Price Prediction for Uber and Lyft

---

Welcome to the Price Prediction for Uber and Lyft repository! This repository contains code, data, and resources related to the price prediction models for rideshare services like Uber and Lyft. The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the prices of rides based on various factors.

## Dataset

This dataset contains information about Uber and Lyft trips in Boston, MA from November 26, 2018, to December 18, 2018. The dataset can be used to study price trends between Uber and Lyft using a linear regression model. However, this dataset contains many missing values (NA). The dataset was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma)

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to build predictive models that estimate the prices for Uber and Lyft rides. The models take into account several factors such as distance, time of day, weather conditions, and surge pricing to provide accurate price predictions. By leveraging historical data and machine learning algorithms, we can develop models that help users estimate the cost of their rides in advance.

The repository contains the following components:

1. **Data**: This directory holds the dataset used for training and evaluating the models. It may include historical ride data, weather data, and other relevant information.

2. **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization steps. The notebooks provide a step-by-step guide to understanding the price prediction process.

3. **Models**: This directory stores the trained machine learning models. It includes saved model files or scripts necessary for model deployment and inference.

4. **Documentation**: This directory contains additional documentation, such as data dictionaries, explanations of model features, and any other relevant information.
